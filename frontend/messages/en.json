When turning, each spring moves independently — zero disturbance to your partner. After 10 minutes, pressure points across your body are evenly released and your spine maintains its natural curve. Suitable for back, side, and all sleeping positions.",

Baland's patented comfort resin cotton and high-elasticity seven-hole fiber cotton provide multi-layer support. Antibacterial & anti-mite treatment: YiKang (Korea) professional agent with imported fire-retardant cotton fabric, certified fire-retardant."

# Current content review for 皇室百兰 website (2026-02-25 12:56Z)

_**User**_

I need to understand ALL the current content on the 皇室百兰 e-commerce website that would need to be updated with real company data. Please examine these files and report back their FULL current content (especially any mock/placeholder text, product data, hotel names, company descriptions, certifications, etc.):

1. Backend seed data: d:/Shopline/backend/prisma/seed.ts - report all product names, descriptions, prices, and stock
2. Homepage sections: Look in d:/Shopline/frontend/components/sections/ - report all section text content (HeroSection, TrustSection, HotelCasesSection, ProductHighlightSection, TechSection, SocialProofSection, CTASection)
3. Brand page: d:/Shopline/frontend/app/[locale]/brand/page.tsx - report all content
4. Translation files: d:/Shopline/frontend/messages/zh.json - report all Chinese text content
5. Translation files: d:/Shopline/frontend/messages/en.json and ja.json - report key sections

Report everything in detail so I can compare with the real PDF data.

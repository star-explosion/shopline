# PDF content update verification (2026-02-25 13:52Z)

_**User**_

Check the current state of these files to determine if the PDF-based content update has been implemented. Look for these specific markers:

1. In `d:/Shopline/frontend/components/sections/HotelCasesSection.tsx` - does it reference "Royal Baland" or "国宾馆" (indicators of the PDF update), or does it still say "洲际" or "希尔顿"?

2. In `d:/Shopline/frontend/messages/zh.json` - does the hero section reference "Royal Baland" or "酒店床垫工程专家", or does it still say "Royal Sleep" and "500+"?

3. In `d:/Shopline/backend/prisma/seed.ts` - does it reference "比利时" (Belgium) latex or "斯里兰卡" (Sri Lanka)?

4. In `d:/Shopline/frontend/components/sections/TrustSection.tsx` - does it still have "SGS" certification or has it been replaced with "CPED" / "中国著名品牌"?

Report what you find for each file. Thoroughness: quick.
